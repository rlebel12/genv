# Example

This command demonstrates how one may use the `genv` package to read environment variables. For the command to work without error, three environment variables must be set:
* `STRING_VAR`: set to any non-empty string
* `INT_VAR`: set to a string that can be parsed as an integer
* `BOOL_VAR`: set to a string that can be parsed as a boolean, e.g. (`true`, `false`)
